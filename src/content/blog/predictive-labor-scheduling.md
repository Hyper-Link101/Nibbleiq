Labor is typically the highest or second-highest cost for a restaurant, often running 30-35% of revenue. Scheduling effectively is the holy grail of restaurant profitability.

Too many staff? You burn cash standing around.
Too few? Service suffers, guests don't return, and revenue drops.

## The Problem with Static Scheduling

Most scheduling is done based on "gut feel" or simply copying last week's schedule. This fails to account for:
*   Local events (sports games, concerts)
*   Weather patterns
*   Holidays
*   Recent sales trends

## What is Predictive Scheduling?

Predictive scheduling uses historical data and machine learning to forecast future sales down to the hour, and then recommends the exact number of labor hours needed to support that volume.

### How It Works

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The system analyzes 2+ years of your POS data.
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** It identifies trends (e.g., "Fridays are up 10% this month" or "Rain decreases patio sales by 40%").
3.  **Forecast:** It generates a projected sales number for every hour of the upcoming week.
4.  **Labor Standards:** It applies your custom labor model (e.g., "1 server per $400 in sales" or "1 cook per 30 covers").
5.  **Output:** A suggested schedule that hits your target labor percentage perfectly.

## Benefits

*   **Consistency:** Hit your labor targets every single week.
*   **Fairness:** Staff aren't cut early or overwhelmed; the schedule matches the demand.
*   **Time Savings:** Managers stop agonizing over the schedule and simply review/approve the AI recommendation.

## Implementing in Your Restaurant

Start by auditing your current labor model. Do you know exactly how many labor hours you *should* use for $10,000 in sales? Once you define the math, AI can automate the execution.
