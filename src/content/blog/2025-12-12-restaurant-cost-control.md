## The Old Way: COGS % Obsession

For decades, restaurant operators have been told that Prime Cost (COGS + Labor) must be under 60% (or 55% for QSRs). Managers spend hours every week trying to shave 0.5% off their food cost percentage.

But here's the truth: **You don't take percentages to the bank. You take dollars.**

In 2026, with rising wages and volatile food prices, the old models are breaking. A menu item might have a 25% food cost but only contribute $4 to margin. Another might have a 35% food cost but contribute $12. Which one would you rather sell?

## The New Way: Contribution Margin & Throughput

Successful operators are shifting focus to **Contribution Margin per Labor Hour**.

> **Formula:** (Total Sales - Variable Costs) / Total Labor Hours

This metric tells you exactly how much profit your operation generates for every hour of work you pay for. It normalizes efficiency across different dayparts and locations.

### 1. Vendor Pricing Visibility

You can't control costs if you don't know what you're paying. Most invoices sit in a pile for weeks before being entered. By then, the price hike has already eaten your margin.

Modern tools (like NibbleIQ) ingest invoices in real-time, flagging price deviations immediately.

### 2. Predictive Labor Scheduling

Scheduling based on "last year's sales" is a recipe for disaster. 2026 requires AI-driven forecasting that accounts for:
* Local events
* Weather
* Recent growth trends
* Holiday shifts

### 3. Menu Engineering for Margin

Stop looking at just food cost %. Map your menu on a matrix of **Popularity vs. Contribution Margin**.

* **Stars:** High Margin, High Popularity (Keep these consistent)
* **Puzzles:** High Margin, Low Popularity (Promote these)
* **Plowhorses:** Low Margin, High Popularity (Raise prices or lower portion cost)
* **Dogs:** Low Margin, Low Popularity (86 these immediately)

## Conclusion

Cost control isn't about buying cheaper tomatoes. It's about operational intelligence. It's about having the data to make decisions *before* the P&L comes out.
