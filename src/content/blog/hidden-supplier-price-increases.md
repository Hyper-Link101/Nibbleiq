Restaurant margins are notoriously thin, often hovering between 3-5%. In this environment, every penny counts. Yet, many restaurant groups are unknowingly bleeding thousands of dollars every month due to a silent killer: **hidden supplier price increases**.

## The "Creep" Phenomenon

Price creep happens when a supplier slightly increases the price of an item—say, increasing the cost of a case of tomatoes by $0.50. It’s small enough that a busy kitchen manager or chef might not notice it while signing an invoice, but across hundreds of items and dozens of locations, these small increases compound rapidly.

For a restaurant group with 10 locations, a 1% undetected increase in Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) can translate to **$250,000+ in lost profit annually**.

## Why Manual Audits Fail

Most restaurants rely on manual invoice processing. Someone receives the delivery, checks it against the order guide, and signs off. Later, an accountant or bookkeeper enters the invoice into the accounting system.

The problem?
1. **Volume:** There are too many line items to check every single price history manually.
2. **Time:** Kitchen staff are focused on prep and service, not forensic accounting.
3. **Data Silos:** The person receiving the goods often doesn't have the contract price list in front of them.

## The AI Solution

This is where AI-driven operational intelligence comes in. Platforms like NibbleIQ ingest invoices automatically—reading line items, quantities, and *unit prices*—and instantly compare them against:
*   Historical prices
*   Contracted prices
*   Market averages

When a discrepancy is found, the system alerts you immediately. Instead of waiting for the end-of-month P&L to realize your food cost is up, you know the moment the invoice hits the system.

## Taking Action

To protect your margins:
1.  **Centralize Purchasing:** Ensure all locations are ordering from approved vendor lists.
2.  **Digitize Invoices:** Stop relying on paper. Get data into a system that can analyze it.
3.  **Set Thresholds:** Configure alerts for any price increase over 3-5%.

By shining a light on these hidden costs, you can hold suppliers accountable and keep your hard-earned profits where they belong—in your pocket.
