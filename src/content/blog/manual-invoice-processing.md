In the digital age, it's shocking how many restaurant back offices still run on paper. Crates of invoices, stacks of receipts, and hours spent manually keying data into spreadsheets or accounting software.

It’s not just "the way things are done." It’s a massive drain on your resources.

## The Hidden Costs

### 1. Labor Hours
The average restaurant manager spends **10-15 hours per week** on back-office admin. That’s time not spent training staff, improving guest experience, or ensuring food quality. If you pay a manager $65k/year, you're spending nearly $20k of that salary on data entry.

### 2. Human Error
Manual data entry has an error rate of roughly 1-4%. In a low-margin business, a "fat finger" error on an inventory count or invoice amount can skew your P&L significantly, leading to bad decisions based on bad data.

### 3. Delayed Insights
If you're processing invoices manually, you're likely doing it in batches—maybe once a week, or even end of month. This means you are driving the business looking in the rear-view mirror. You can't fix a food cost issue that happened three weeks ago.

## Automating the Back Office

Modern operational intelligence tools use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI to digitize this entire workflow.

*   **Snap & Go:** Managers take a photo of an invoice or forward a PDF email.
*   **Instant Extraction:** The AI reads the vendor, date, line items, and totals.
*   **GL Coding:** Items are automatically mapped to the correct General Ledger codes.
*   **Sync:** The data is pushed directly to your accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.).

## The ROI of Automation

Switching to automated processing typically yields:
*   **90% reduction** in time spent on AP (Accounts Payable).
*   **Real-time** visibility into spending.
*   **Higher accuracy** in financial reporting.

Stop paying your managers to be data entry clerks. Give them the tools to be true operators.
