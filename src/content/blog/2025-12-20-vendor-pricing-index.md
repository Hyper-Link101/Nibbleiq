## The "Creep" Effect

We recently analyzed over 50,000 restaurant invoices from across the US. The data revealed a disturbing trend: **"Creep" inflation.**

Suppliers aren't raising prices by 10% overnight. They are raising them by $0.15 here and $0.40 there, week after week.

### Key Findings

1. **Produce Volatility:** Lettuce and tomato prices have seen a 14% variance month-over-month, often disguised as "fuel surcharges" or "delivery fees".
2. **Protein Premiums:** Beef prices are stabilizing, but poultry is seeing a steady 2% monthly increase in many regions.
3. **Packaging Costs:** The silent killer. To-go packaging costs have risen 18% YoY, yet many operators haven't adjusted their delivery menu pricing to match.

## How to Fight Back

### Audit Every Line Item
Manual auditing is impossible at scale. You need automated ingestion that compares every line item against your contracted price or last paid price.

### Consolidate Purchasing
Are you splitting orders across 4 broadliners? You're losing leverage. Consolidate to 1-2 primary vendors to negotiate better "drop sizes" and contract pricing.

### Menu Agility
If avocado prices spike 40%, you need the agility to remove guacamole from the featured burger *today*, not next month.
